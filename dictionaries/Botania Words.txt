Message
from
Elven
Garde
Greetings
noticed
that
our
portal
was
opened
via
link
from
another
world
That's
rather
shocking
news
indeed
thank
you
very
much
for
providing
with
repository
the
knowledge
from
your
world
keep
date
what
happened
since
left

see
it's
doing
well
After
some
discussion
with
the
high
council
Elven
Garde
have
decided
cooperate
with
you
You
see
reading
through
your
Lexica
Botania
has
shown
good
amount
resources
from
your
world
that
would
extremely
keen
get
our
hands
on
these
are
non-existent
our
lands
The
link
you
have
managed
establish
rather
weak
living
beings
will
able
through
you
already
know
However
there's
positive
side
this
the
link
strikes
the
fabric
time
both
our
worlds
way
where
doesn't
keep
them
sync
that's
the
reason
why
you
received
your
book
back
quickly
When
comes
Mana
and
other
magical
energies
are
plenty
stocked
them
worry
not
about
the
portal
closing
our
end
Let's
put
this
prospect
order
for
the
advance
both
our
civilizations
vow
accept
given
set
resources
from
your
world
lack
ours
exchange
for
resources
you
lack
yours
have
taken
the
liberty
assigning
our
best
scribes
put
together
great
set
knowledge
from
our
world
we're
willing
share
you
can
find
your
lexicon
just
you'd
find
knowledge
from
yours
hope
you
find
enlightening
and
that
encourages
you
invest
our
materials
Last
but
not
least
keep
mind
that
you
decide
send
something

The

often
enacted
the

which
the
only
way
acquire
Gaia

which

good
idea
Ritual
Gaia
One
would
think
that
combining
two
the
most
powerful
resources
known
existance
the
form
Terrasteel
and
Gaia
Spirits
would
create
unstoppable
material
seems
that
the
material
very
much
stoppable
though
fact
the
two
forces
cancel
eachother
out
when
combined
into
ingot
creating
utterly
useless
alloy
This
ingot
though
due
the
concentrated
energy
and
power
it
does
allow
for
the
summoning
stronger
Gaia
Guardian
with
more
resistance
strength
and
speedFor
all
this
also
drops
more

than

this
section

just
bunch
pieces

the
looks
them
they
seem
like
they
were
taken
from
document
from
the

contents
should
contain
historical
knowledge
but
doubtfully
anything
important
the

itself
few
millennia
have
passed
since
The
Shattering
The
amount
who
actually
know
about
what
really
happened
that
day
rather
minute
Nidavellir
broke
down
and
while
the
Dwarves'
incredible
resistance
helped
great
part
their
technology
and
civilization
was
eradicated
Muspelheim
what
was
previously
the
very
opposite
corner
the
World
Tree
herself
collided
with
Asgard
merging
the
two
worlds
apocalypse
eradicating
any
life
remaining
that
world
There's
theories
that
state
Hel
was
also
involved
the
event
although
none
were
ever
confirmed
Fissures
the
ground
Jotunheim
opened
all
around
massacring
great
portion
the
Giants
who
lived
there
its
current
status
remains
unknown
Niflheim
seemed
stay
place
unlike
Muspelheim
interestingly
enough
Since
contained
known
lifeforms
can
admit
that
damage
irrelevant
Lastly
ourselves
the
elves
Alfheim
the
damage
our
world
was
somewhat
split
The
Salamander
and
Undine
clans
suffered
massive
cut
their
population
due
the
unstableness
their
volcanic
and
aquatic
environments
respectively
Most
the
Sylph
were
completely
intact
due
their
extraordinary
flight
capabilities
the
Spriggan
also
had
fairly
small
scale
consequences
During
that
time
our
civilization
prospects
were
fairly
weak
and
our
choices
residence
were
mostly
just
huts
made
Dreamwood
so
luckily
rebuilding
was
little
chore
Allewyn
our
emissary
Asgard
witnessed
this
happening
everything
happened
faster
than
the
birth
Pixie
Thor

Bifrost

luckilly
she
was
here
unscathed
least
that's
what
records
say
regardless
few
millennia
later
she's
passed
off
long
ago
Right
now
our
major
concern
the
status
Midgard
The
collapse
the
Bifrost
broke
any
interaction
between
the
various
worlds
but
the
sheer
quantity
Mana
residues
have
left
behind
will
surely
have
lingered
and
infused
the
world
with
life
all
over
again

it's
